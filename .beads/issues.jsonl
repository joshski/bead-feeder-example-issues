{"id":"bead-554","title":"Implement per-user repository clones with dynamic token auth","description":"## Problem\n\nCurrently, repository clones are shared across all users at:\n```\ntemp/github-repositories/{owner}/{repo}/\n```\n\nThis causes two issues:\n1. **Push fails**: The token is stripped from the remote URL after cloning (for security), so `bd sync` can't push\n2. **Token ambiguity**: If multiple users access the same repo, whose token should be used?\n\n## Solution\n\nChange to per-user clones:\n```\ntemp/github-repositories/{user_id}/{owner}/{repo}/\n```\n\nEach user gets their own clone, and their token is used dynamically for git operations (push/pull).\n\n## Relevant Files\n\n- `api/config.ts:30` - `getRepoPath()` determines clone location, needs to accept user ID\n- `api/server.ts:364-365` - calls `getRepoPath()`, needs to pass user ID\n- `api/server.ts:551-566` - commit/sync flow, needs to call `pushRepository()` after commit\n- `api/git-service.ts:305-353` - `pushRepository()` already handles dynamic token auth correctly\n- `api/git-service.ts:118-206` - `sparseCloneRepository()` strips token after clone (line 197-200)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- User ID can be extracted from the GitHub token (already done at `/api/auth/me`)\n- The `pushRepository()` function already implements the pattern: temporarily set authenticated URL → push → restore non-authenticated URL\n- Consider whether to keep or remove the token-stripping in `sparseCloneRepository()` (less critical with per-user clones)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"joshuachisholm@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-17T00:21:25.417844959Z","created_by":"Josh Chisholm","updated_at":"2026-01-17T00:21:25.417844959Z"}
